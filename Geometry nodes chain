QUESTION
how do i make a chain in blender with geometry nodes, I want to even control the random rotation or the precise rotation of every ring of the chain

ANSWER
Creating a chain in Blender using Geometry Nodes is a powerful way to procedurally generate and control the attributes of each link in the chain, including their position, rotation, and scale. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you create a chain and control the rotation of each ring:


Step 1: Setting Up the Geometry Nodes
Open Blender and create a new project.
Add a new Geometry Nodes modifier to your object:
Select the object (e.g., a cube).
Go to the Modifiers tab.
Click "Add Modifier" and choose "Geometry Nodes."
Click "New" to create a new Geometry Nodes network.
Step 2: Creating the Chain Base
Create a Curve Path:

Add a curve to define the path of your chain. Go to Add > Curve > Bezier Curve.
Add Geometry Nodes:

In the Geometry Nodes editor, you'll start with the default "Group Input" and "Group Output" nodes.
Step 3: Distributing Points and Instancing Rings
Distribute Points on Curve:
Add a Distribute Points on Faces node (add it by pressing Shift+A > Point > Distribute Points on Faces).
Connect the Curve output to the Geometry input of the Distribute Points on Faces node.
Instance Rings:
Add an Instance on Points node (Shift+A > Point > Instance on Points).
Create a ring (you can use a torus mesh) and drag it into the Geometry Nodes editor.
Connect the ring geometry to the Instance input of the Instance on Points node.
Connect the Points output from the Distribute Points on Faces node to the Points input of the Instance on Points node.
Connect the Instances output from the Instance on Points node to the Group Output.
Step 4: Controlling Rotation
Rotate Instances:
Add a Rotate Instances node (Shift+A > Point > Rotate Instances).
Insert the Rotate Instances node between the Instance on Points node and the Group Output node.
To control the rotation, you can add a Random Value node or a Vector Math node:
For random rotation: Add a Random Value node (Shift+A > Input > Random Value), set the type to Vector, and connect it to the Rotation input of the Rotate Instances node.
For precise control: Add a Vector Math node (Shift+A > Vector > Vector Math), set it to Add, and connect it to the Rotation input of the Rotate Instances node. Use additional nodes like Combine XYZ to manually input the rotation values.
Step 5: Fine-Tuning
Adjust Distribution:
Modify the density or other parameters in the Distribute Points on Faces node to control the spacing of the rings.
Tweak Rotation:
Adjust the random value range or the specific rotation values to get the desired effect.
Step 6: Finalizing
Convert to Mesh:

If you need to convert the procedural chain to a mesh, you can use the Convert to Mesh node at the end of your Geometry Nodes network.
Apply Modifiers:

Once you are satisfied with the setup, you can apply the Geometry Nodes modifier to make the changes permanent (if needed).
Here’s a basic node setup outline for clarity:

Group Input → Distribute Points on Faces → Instance on Points → Rotate Instances → Group Output
Additional control nodes like Random Value or Vector Math for fine-tuning rotation
This setup allows you to have a procedurally generated chain with control over the random or precise rotation of each ring.
